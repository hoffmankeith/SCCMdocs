# Supported operating systems for clients and devices for System Center Configuration Manager

*Applies to: System Center Configuration Manager (Current Branch)*


 System Center Configuration Manager supports installing client software on a variety of Windows, Mac, Linux, and UNIX computers.  

 **Requirements and limitations for all clients:**  

-   Changing the startup type or **Log on as** settings for any Configuration Manager service is not supported and can prevent key services from running correctly.    

-   Installing or running the Configuration Manager client for Linux or UNIX or the client for Mac on computers under an account other than root is not supported. Doing so can prevent key services from running correctly.  

##  Windows computers  
 You can use the Configuration Manager client that is included with Configuration Manager to manage the following Windows operating systems. For more information, see [How to deploy clients to Windows computers in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-windows-computers.md).  

**Supported operating systems:**  


-  **Windows Server 2016**: Standard, Datacenter <sup>1</sup>
  - This operating system is supported beginning with Configuration Manager version 1606, with the hotfix rollup from KB3186654 (or the baseline version of 1606, which was released in October 2016).  

-   **Windows Server 2012 R2** (x64): Standard, Datacenter <sup>1</sup>    

-   **Windows Storage Server 2012 R2** (x64)    

-   **Windows Server 2012** (x64): Standard, Datacenter <sup>1</sup>    

-   **Windows Storage Server 2012** (x64)    

-   **Windows Server 2008 R2 with SP1** (x64): Standard, Enterprise, Datacenter <sup>1</sup>

-   **Windows 8.1** (x86, x64): Professional, Enterprise    

-   **Windows 8** (x86, x64): Professional, Enterprise    

-   **Windows 7 with SP1** (x86, x64): Professional, Enterprise, and Ultimate    

-   **The Server Core installation of Windows Server 2016** (x64) <sup>2</sup>
  - This operating system is supported beginning with version 1606 with the hotfix rollup from KB3186654 (or the baseline version of 1606, which was released in October of 2016). 


-   **The Server Core installation of Windows Server 2012 R2** (x64) <sup>2</sup>

 <sup>1</sup> Datacenter releases are supported but not certified for Configuration Manager. Hotfix support is not offered for issues that are specific to Windows Server Datacenter Edition.  

 <sup>2</sup> To support client push installation, the computer that runs this operating system version must run the File Server role service for the File and Storage Services server role. For information about installing Windows features on a Server Core computer, see [Install Server Roles and Features on a Server Core Server](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=299359) in the Windows Server 2012 TechNet library.  


##  Windows Embedded computers  
 You can manage Windows Embedded devices by installing Configuration Manager client software on the device.  For more information, see [Planning for client deployment to Windows Embedded devices in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-windows-embedded-devices.md).  

**Requirements and limitations:**

##  Linux and UNIX servers  
 You can manage Linux and UNIX servers with the Configuration Manager client for Linux and UNIX.  

 The Linux and UNIX client installation packages are  are not supplied with the Configuration Manager media. Download the **Clients for Additional Operating Systems** from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525184). In addition to client installation packages, the client download includes the script that manages the installation of the client on each computer.  

**Requirements and limitations:**  

-   To review operating system file dependencies for the client for Linux and UNIX, see [Prerequisites for Client Deployment to Linux and UNIX Servers](../../../core/clients/deploy/plan/planning-for-client-deployment-to-linux-and-unix-computers.md#BKMK_ClientDeployPrereqforLnU).  

-   For an overview of supported management capabilities for Linux or UNIX, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers.md).  

-   For supported versions of Linux and UNIX, the listed version includes all subsequent minor versions. For example,  CentOS version 6 includes  CentOS 6.3. Similarly, support for an operating system that uses service packs (such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP1) includes subsequent service packs for that operating system version.  

-   For information about client installation packages and the Universal Agent, see [How to deploy clients to UNIX and Linux servers in System Center Configuration Manager](../../../core/clients/deploy/deploy-clients-to-unix-and-linux-servers.md).
